I'll create a Python script to build a binary classifier using logistic regression on the provided `breast-cancer-wisconsin.data` dataset. The goal is to predict the class (benign: 2, malignant: 4) based on the given features. The script will follow the mini-guide, using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib, and include threshold tuning and evaluation metrics. I'll also address the interview questions separately for clarity.

 Approach
1. Dataset Choice: Use `breast-cancer-wisconsin.data` for binary classification (benign: 2, malignant: 4). The dataset has 11 columns: ID (column 0) and 9 features (columns 1–9), with column 10 as the class label.
2. Features: Use columns 1–9 (e.g., clump thickness, uniformity of cell size) as features. Drop the ID column.
3. Preprocessing: Handle missing values (denoted by `?`), encode the target (2 → 0, 4 → 1), standardize features, and split data into train/test sets.
4. Model: Train a logistic regression model and evaluate using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
5. Threshold Tuning: Adjust the decision threshold to optimize precision/recall, prioritizing recall for medical diagnostics.
6. Visualization: Plot the ROC curve and save it as a PNG.

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
   - Loads `breast-cancer-wisconsin.data` with appropriate column names.
   - Drops the ID column (irrelevant for prediction).
   - Handles missing values in `Bare_Nuclei` (16 instances) by imputing with the median.
   - Converts the `Class` column to binary: 2 (benign) → 0, 4 (malignant) → 1.
   - Selects 9 features (columns 1–9) and the target (`Class`).

2. Train/Test Split:
   - Splits data into 80% training and 20% testing, with stratification to maintain class balance (~65% benign, ~35% malignant).

3. Model Training:
   - Uses a `Pipeline` to combine `StandardScaler` (for feature standardization) and `LogisticRegression`.
   - Fits the model on the training data.

4. Evaluation:
   - Computes accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report (precision, recall, F1-score), and ROC-AUC score.
   - The confusion matrix shows true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true positives (TP).

5. Threshold Tuning:
   - Tests thresholds from 0.1 to 0.9 to maximize F1-score for the positive class (malignant).
   - Outputs the best threshold and corresponding F1-score.
